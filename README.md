## Bonk_CSFML

This program was made using the CSFML Graphical Library, a binding of the C++ SFML Library.

I used it to train my skills and learn newer ones as I will need them for my studies next year.
The purpose is not to make a beautiful looking game with amazing gameplay but to understand new ways of coding I was lacking last year such as function pointers, more advanced structure usages, allocation and free with the use of malloc, etc...

I also struggled a lot with the CSFML Library, but I also really like graphical projects so I though that using the CSFML would be a nice way to train all of these skills during my free time before going back to uni.

- Requirements

You will need to have the CSFML library installed on your computer. It is a binding of the C++ SFML library.
